## [14:30] account-settings — add unsaved changes indicator and confirmation
- **Files:** `components/settings/*-form.tsx`, `components/settings/account-settings-tabs.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/settings/account/page.tsx`
- **Why:** Users could lose unsaved changes when switching tabs or navigating away. Added visual indicators and confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental data loss.
